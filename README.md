# CROW: Clerical Resolution Online Widget
This repository contains CROW, the Clerical Resolution Online Widget, an open-source project designed to help data linkers with their clerical matching needs once they have linked data together!

The CROW reads record pair data from a CSV file, presents it in an easy to read and compare format and has tools that can help the clerical matcher with decisions. 

The aims of the CROW are to:

* Meet the clerical matching needs of both large and small scale projects. 
* Get clerical matching results faster compared to other free to us software.
* Minimise error during clerical review by presenting record pair data one at a time and in a easy to read and compare format. 
* Be easy to use both for the clerical matcher when reviewing record pairs and the clerical coordinator setting up the project. 
* Be open and transparent, so the community can use the software without restrictions.

## Installation and Use
The CROW is a piece of software that runs in Python, it uses Pandas to read and update the record pair data and it uses tkinter to display and let users interact with the record pair data. 

To install and use the CROW simply pull this repository into your current working environment and use it in a Python IDE of your choice. 

## Documentation
The most up to date documentation can be found in the [instructions folder](https://github.com/Data-Linkage/Clerical_Resolution_Online_Widget/tree/main/Instructions). Here you will be able to find instructions for setting the CROW up for your project and instructions you can give to your clerical matchers on how to run the CROW once it is set up.
